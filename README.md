Recipe Search Buttons is a mod which adds keybinds for performing JEI recipe and usage lookups on the blocks or fluids you're looking at.

Press Numpad 1 to view a block's recipes, and Numpad 2 to view a block's usages.

This feature is originally from [Hwyla](https://github.com/TehNut-Mods/HWYLA).

This mod requires [JEI](https://github.com/mezz/JustEnoughItems).
